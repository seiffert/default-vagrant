# My Vagrant/Puppet Default Setup 

## Setup

-   Install vagrant on your system
    see [vagrantup.com](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html)

-   Install vagrant-hostmaster on your system
    see [mosaicxm/vagrant-hostmaster](https://github.com/mosaicxm/vagrant-hostmaster#installation)

-   Get a base box with puppet support
    see [vagrantup.com docs](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/boxes.html)

-   Get a copy of this repository. You can do this either by integrating it as a git submodule or by just checking it out and copying the files. 
    Prefarably, the contents of this repository should be placed in a directory `vagrant` inside your project's root dir.

-   Copy `vagrant/Personalization.dist` to `vagrant/Personalization` and modify `vagrant/Personalization` according to your needs.

    Example:
    ```ruby
    $vhost = "test"
    $ip = "192.168.10.42"

    $use_nfs = true

    $base_box = "ubuntu-server-i386"

    $webserver = "nginx"
    ```
        
    -   Execute "vagrant up" in the directory vagrant.

## Infrastructure

After performing the steps listed above, you will have the following environment set up:

- A running virtual machine with your project on it
- Your project directory will be mounted as a shared folder in this virtual machine
- Your project will be accessible via a browser (go to `http://{$vhost}.dev/[app_dev.php]`)
- You can now start customizing the new virtual machine. In most cases, the machine should correspond to the infrastructure your production server(s) provide.
